## Introduction

Our project centered around examining ESPN NBA player data from 19 NBA seasons (from the 2001-2002 season to the 2019-2020 season). More specifically, the data captures the top 50 scorers in each of those seasons and includes statistical categories like rebounds, assists, etc. From the data, we wanted to identify various historical trends to see how the game of basketball has changed over time within the NBA. We know that the NBA has changed drastically over the past couple decades -- with more players developing their 3-point shot, less reliance with the center position, and changing of the guard, so to speak, of the top players. Our objective was to take these various attributes in the data set to tell a story on what has happened in the NBA over the past couple decades. In pursuit of this, part of our goal was to use the data to answer heavily debated topics amongst avid NBA fans from a statistical perspective. These questions included things like "As players like Steph Curry took over the league, how has the 3-point shot changed over time by position?" and "Should LeBron James have won more MVPs in his career"? We also analyzed interesting questions like "How do different players rank in each of the statistical categories?" and "Based on certain stats, which players would we want to select in a top 5 starting lineup"? From these answers, we wanted to depict how well our analysis matched the reality of the NBA. We wanted to see if the data set that we used could help to answer these heavily debated topics in the NBA and capture the NBA's evolution over time.

## The Data

This data set shows the top 50 NBA players based on Points per Game (PPG) from the 2001-2002 to 2019-2020 season from ESPN.com. We chose to use this data set because it would allow us to see many statistics of the top 50 players throughout several seasons such as position, minutes played, points made, three point field goals made, rebounds, assists, and several more attributes. This allowed us to analyze how trends have evolved over the years, how player rankings can be impacted by different statistics, and much more. We obtained this data by web scraping ESPN.com using the BeautifulSoup library. Because it was for several years rather than one year, this involved developing a for loop to web scrape each web page for every season. Then, several for loops were used to create appropriate lists of the different players in each season along with their specific statistics. 

Our data set was obtained from ESPN.com and, for the most part, we did not have to do much cleaning. We verified there were no duplicates in the code. We found, though, that in the data set there was one player (Eddy Curry) who had an "NA" value in the dataset. Based on our knowledge of the NBA, we knew Eddy Curry was a Center in the league and edited the data set so that he would be identified as such. Also, we saw that the data set contained positions for Forwards and Guards (in addition to Point Guards, Shooting Guards, Small Forwards, and Power Forwards) until the 2016-2017 season. We determined to keep those positions the way they are to reflect how these players' positions were represented.

## Experimental Design 

In order to answer the question of, "As players like Steph Curry took over the league, how has the 3-point shot changed over time by position?," we wanted to understand if there was an increased reliance on the number of three-point field goals over time. So, a series is first created, which is grouped by Season and by Position. With that grouping, the average three-point field goals are found for each position within each of the seasons in this dataset. To make it easier to visualize, each position is separated into their own data sets, so there are now seven series (one for each of the seven types of positions) which show the average three-point field goals by Season. Then, a similar process is used to find the number of players in each position over the years in order to further understand if there actually is less reliance on the Center position currently. A data frame is created that groups the data by Season and by Position, which then finds the number of players within each subset using the unstack function. This is then separated by each specific position, as well, so that plots could be created to show the number of players in each season by position. Finally, 14 plots were created to show the average 3-point field goals over the seasons by position as well as the number of players in each position over the years.

For our next query, to acquire information on any player that is in the dataset, user input was implemented to allow any user to determine information on a player of choice. Based on the player name, a data frame was created with all the columns the player is attributed with in the dataset. If the length of this data frame was less than one, then the code tells the user there is no player by that name. If the length of this data frame was one or greater, that player's first year, first position, last year, and last position in the dataset are indexed. The number of times the player makes the top 50 list, average number of games played, and average number of points scored per game were also calculated from this data frame. This information was then organized into a user-friendly print statement to provide statistics about the indicated player of choice.

Furthermore, in order to acquire a holistic list of the top all-around players in the NBA, a ranking system was implemented to compare across the different categories specified in the dataset. The players statistics were grouped by their name, averaging across all the times they appeared in the dataset, so that they only had one value for each category. The categories that were selected and deemed important statistics when considering the best all-around player were the following: points per game, field goal percentage, 3-point field goal percentage, free throw percentage, rebounds per game, assists per game, steals per game, and blocks per game. Within each of these columns, the player's were ranked from 1 to 254 based on their statistics for that category. For example, a player could be ranked number 1 for points per game, but ranked number 254 for free throw percentage. These ranked values were then averaged across all categories per player to give them an all-around average rank score (lower average indicates higher all-around rank). The output displays a list of the top 5 players that were calculated based on this ranking system within these categories to be the top all-around players for this dataset.

</p>

Because this code analyzed the averages across all the seasons the player appeared in the dataset, additional code was also written to list who the top all-around players were for each season. A for loop was created to rank the player's statistics for each individual year of the dataset. The categories that were selected and deemed important statistics when considering the best all-around player were: points per game, field goal percentage, 3-point field goal percentage, free throw percentage, rebounds per game, assists per game, steals per game, and blocks per game. Within each of these columns, the player's value was ranked from 1 to 50 based on their associated value for that category. These ranked values were then averaged across all categories per player to give them an all-around average rank score. The top 5 overall average ranked players for each year were added to a dataframe to display the top 5 players within every season. Also, to learn about a specific season, user input was implemented where the user inputs a valid year within the dataset and the code displays the top 5 player's names in order for that season based on the indicated ranking system.

In the NBA community, an ongoing debate has always been centered around who the current best players are. We wanted to see if we could determine an elite NBA starting lineup based on the best players of selected attributes in the data set. From the data set, we decided to base our starting lineup on the following attributes: points, rebounds, assists, blocks, and Player Efficiency Rating (PER). We decided on using points, rebounds, and assists because these are the three major statistical categories that are calculated for NBA players. We decided to use blocks to incorporate an attribute that was more reflective of the defensive nature of players. The last element that we used is PER which is a unique statistical category that attempts to capture various statistics (good and bad) into one overarching value. The PER considers a multitude of statistics to determine a score that attempts to represent their contribution on the court. We determined that these categories would create a starting lineup that would be composed of some of the top NBA players in the last couple decades. These attributes also allow us to develop a starting lineup that captures various essential skill sets to NBA basketball. For the visualization aspect of this analysis, we developed box plots for each observed statistical category to see the distribution between each value. Our goal was to find the player associated with the maximum value of each attribute.

To determine the appropriate players to place in our top 5 starting lineup, we had to develop four different loops for each statistical category we observed. These loops found the name of the player, position, season, and statistical value for the player with the best attribute in the observed statistical category. For every attribute, we first had to find the maximum (best) value in each statistical category. From there, we were able to determine an index to find that value's associated player name, player position, and associated season. As mentioned, we created a for loop on each observed attribute to determine the player with the highest value and place them into our starting lineup.

Another interesting question that we wanted to answer was if LeBron deserved to win more than the 4 MVPs he has won. This question comes out of a widely debated topic in the NBA community that LeBron has lost MVPs due to media bias, NBA politics, etc. Many players and fans believe that LeBron has been snubbed of multiple MVP awards as he has consistently remained arguably the best player over the last decade. From this debate, we wanted to compare the statistics of the MVPs in each season represented within our data set and compare them with Lebron's statistics of that season. We did not include any seasons that LeBron was not in the league or was already named the MVP. 

To perform this analysis, we researched who the past MVPs were based on the seasons represented in our data set. We faced no issues with an MVP winner not being included in the data set of the season that they won. From a real-world perspective, we see that this makes sense because points per game is an important attribute taken under consideration when selecting the MVP and we would expect any MVP to be part of the top 50 scorers in that season.

For our code, we chronologically organized the MVP players in a list, looped through each player in the MVP list, and then stored certain statistics for the year they won the MVP award. We skipped any season that LeBron was not in the year, had already won the MVP award, or was not in that season's data set. Using data aggregation and filtering, we collected the selected statistics for each MVP and LeBron James. As mentioned, we selected certain statistics to compare between the MVP and LeBron James which included points, assists, rebounds, steals, blocks, and PER. We selected these attributes because we believed that these would be the best attributes in making one-on-one comparisons between the MVP and LeBron. For each comparison between LeBron and an MVP, we developed bar charts to visually see how the players compared to one another.

## Beyond the original specifications

For this project, we took an extra step with our project to incorporate some web scraping within our Python script. The web scraping portion was based on the web scraping assignment that we had earlier in the semester. We expanded this code to capture data over a longer time period and include more observations than in the previous assignment. We used the BeautifulSoup library to scrape the data from the ESPN statistics website and output that data into a suitable CSV format. We gathered the columns/attributes of the data set and stored them into lists to later be translated into a column in a CSV file. We also created an extra column of data to capture the ending season year that each player's statistics were collected for. For each web page that we were collecting data from, we had to create a for loop that went through each web page and scraped all the necessary attributes and then reset the loop so that we could perform the web scraping on the next page. The web scraping component allowed us to collect all the necessary data we needed to perform our analysis to derive information and knowledge in support of our project objectives. From the web scraping, we had to code in some formatting to be able to collect the data that we required and insert it into the CSV file.

An additional aspect we added to this project is the use of user input. First, if an individual wanted to know basic information about a specific player, they could input the name of the player and the code will provide information on how many times they were ranked in the top 50, when they first and last made the list, and the average number of games played and points per game if they are on the list. Second, if an individual wanted to know what the top all-around players are for any year of the dataset, they can input the year they want to see, and the code will provide a list of the top 5 players based on the specified ranking system along with their city and position.

## Results 

First, the question on increased reliance on the three-point shot and decreased reliance on the Center position will be discussed. We saw that the average three-point field goals had increased since 2015 for Centers; however, the number of centers from 2015 had actually decreased, which is what we suspected. Traditionally, Centers do not shoot many three-pointers, which is evident in the plot from 2002-2015. Starting in 2016, however, Centers have started to increase the number of three-pointers, indicating a greater reliance on the three point shot in basketball. 

Additionally, the number of Centers, since 2016, decrease as Point Guards and Shooting Guards have increased, indicating that the traditional definition of a Center's role is evolving and becoming a less relied upon position as three-point shooting increases.

For Guards, there is not a specific trend one can see regarding the 3-point field goals or number of players.

For Point Guards, it seems very clear that the number of three-point field goals has increased steadily from 2012, and the number of Point Guard players has also steadily increased since 2012. So, from our results, it seems that Point Guards rely more on 3-point shots.

The same trend with Point Guards can be seen for Shooting Guards with the number of  three-point field goals as well as the number of Shooting Guards increasing. Point Guards and Shooting Guards have steadily increased the number of 3-point field goals taken since 2012, which may show an overall shift in the frequency and reliance of 3-point field goals in the NBA. The number of Point Guards and Shooting Guards has also increased since 2012, which shows that teams may be putting more importance on PGs and SGs since they typically perform the best when it comes to taking and making 3-point field goals.

For players in the Forward position, there was not much of a trend for three-point field goals.

Small Forwards have started to increase in the number of three-point field goals taken from 2016, but it does not seem that there is much of a correlation to the number of players.

Finally, for Power Forwards, they seem to follow the same trend as Small Forwards.

Next, looking at the results of our ranking system, the results indicated that the top 5 all-around players in the NBA based on their average values through each season they were on the top 50 list includes, in order: Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, James Harden, and LeBron James. The top all-around players per season can be displayed through user input of a selected season. For example, the top all-around players in the 2020 season were in order: Kawhi Leonard, James Harden, Damian Lillard, Anthony Davis, and Nikola Jovic.

In our next query, we focused on five attributes to determine our ideal top 5 starting lineup. As mentioned in our experimental design, we looked at the categories for points per game, rebounds per game, assists per game, blocks per game, and Player Efficiency Rating. We developed visualizations (box plots) to see the distribution between each of the statistical categories. From the visualizations, we saw the range of values for each statistical category as well as the value of the maximum value. These visualizations provided insight into the minimum, median, and maximum values of each category as well. The box plots were also useful in determining the outliers in the data set for each attribute - we see that the maximum value of each observed attribute can be found in the outliers. We see that, from all the box plots, PER is the only statistical category that had outliers for the value of 0. Looking at the data set, all players from the 2001-2002 season had a PER of 0. We determined that this was most likely due to the PER statistic not being collected during that season which is validated by the fact that the statistics that go into the PER calculation are non-zero values since PER takes into account various statistics (i.e. a value of 0 would mean that the player basically had no statistics).

Additionally, we can see from the box plots that blocks per game had the tightest range of values and points per game had the widest range of values. From this, we can probably deduce that blocks per game is the most difficult of the observed categories to achieve for NBA players. Since we are determining the best player in each category, we know that the data point of most interest to us is the maximum value (i.e. the value at the top) of each box plot.

For points, we found that the player that averaged the most points per game in a season was James Harden (a Shooting Guard) by averaging 36.1 points during the 2018-2019 season. For rebounds, we determined that Andre Drummond (a Center) averaged the most rebounds per game in our data set during the 2018-2019 season at 15.1 rebounds per game. For assists, Steve Nash (a Point Guard) averaged the most assists per game (at 11.6 assists per game) during the 2006-2007 season. Tim Duncan (a Center) averaged the most blocks per game during the 2002-2003 season at 2.9 blocks per game. For PER, Giannis Antetokounmpo (a Power Forward) had the highest PER in the data set of 31.94 during the 2019-2020 season. From the attributes that we observed, these five players encompassed our ideal starting lineup. Furthermore, we believe that this was an ideal starting lineup because four of the five people in our starting lineup have won an MVP (Andre Drummond is the only one who has not won an MVP) and three of those MVPs have won more than once (James Harden has only won MVP once). We also have decent coverage of the different positions and skill sets seen on NBA teams. This analysis also provided us insight into who was the top scorer from all the seasons in our data set (a data set focused on the top scorers) and displayed who ranked the best in our other statistical categories.

This analysis would be beneficial to avid NBA fans who may be interested in knowing which players have performed the best in these statistical categories in the past couple decades.. The game of basketball requires an assortment of different skills and abilities and this analysis showcased a variety of different NBA athletes in terms of offensive and defensive ability. As mentioned, we know that many of the players on this list were former MVPs and from our results we have a pretty good understanding as to why that is. 

For our next analysis of our data set, we wanted to determine if there were any seasons in which LeBron James had been snubbed for an NBA award. As we look at the analysis, it is important to note that only a few statistics were observed in these comparisons between the league MVP and LeBron James. There are other factors, outside the scope of this analysis, that drive the winner of the MVP in each season within a real-word scenario (i.e. team performance and other statistical categories). Additionally, LeBron James won the MVP award in 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2013 so we do not provide any analysis in those seasons. For the 2018-2019 season, LeBron James did not play enough games (70%) in the regular season to make ESPN's top 50 scorers list, so we do not show any analysis for that season as well. We also did not include any analysis in the seasons that LeBron James was not in the league (first two seasons in our data set).

   In the 2003-2004 season, LeBron James entered the league as a rookie and, during this season, Kevin Garnett won the league MVP. We can see that Garnett dominated a majority of the observed statistical categories and that his PER was much higher than LeBron James' PER that year. We can say that LeBron James, despite his incredible statistics as a rookie, did not get snubbed for the MVP award. 

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MfsdUmDYU7Tt_Uv8tdQLplZCtxLlcAPkX1R3ObBY8geFy6RFLpbFDrLqcWarM_qiAqdMHFSD3_1QDP0X0CO1v1cnnDWlDYQubqVJ5ORDni_WSt_KCcK1n2Bht2KeGlorLLM3qQYZ)

In the 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 season, Steve Nash was awarded the league MVP in back-to-back years. Looking at the statistical categories (points, assists, rebounds, steals, blocks, and PER) in both seasons, Steve Nash only outperformed LeBron James in the assist category. In every other observed category, LeBron James' statistics were much better than Steve Nash's statistics. We can see that LeBron's PER was also much higher than Steve Nash's PER in both seasons. This demonstrates that LeBron most likely outperformed Steve in other unobserved statistical categories as well. From the analysis we determined that LeBron James had overall better seasons in 2005 and 2006 than Steve Nash and could have won the league MVP in that year. The bar plots visually show the overall better season that LeBron James appeared to have compared to Steve Nash.

In the 2006-2007 season, Dirk Nowitzki won the NBA MVP. Looking at the statistics between Dirk Nowitzki and LeBron James, we determined that their statistics were similar, but that Dirk did better in 4 of the 6 categories. From the PER, we see that Dirk did better than LeBron in that category which may be an indication of why he won the award over LeBron. The higher PER rating by Dirk most likely indicates that there were other statistical attributes that pushed him to win the award over LeBron and other candidates. From the bar chart below, overall, we see that Dirk and LeBron had similar statistics in these categories.

In 2008, Kobe Bryant won the league MVP, and, in 2011, Derrick Rose won the MVP award. Based on the data, we determined that these were two years in which LeBron James was potentially snubbed for an MVP award. LeBron James, for both seasons, had stronger showings in a majority of the observed statistical categories. In 2008, the only statistic that LeBron James did not perform better than Kobe Bryant in was steals (where they averaged the same steals per game) and, in 2009, Derrick Rose only did better in assists and averaged the same number of blocks as James. Otherwise, LeBron James had a strong case to win the MVP award in both of those seasons. From this analysis, we would determine that LeBron James may have been a more viable winner for MVP than Kobe Bryant or Derrick Rose based on the analysis. Again, we also see that LeBron's PER was much higher than the other two athletes which indicates that there are probably other statistical categories that LeBron performed better in as well.

In 2014, Kevin Durant won the MVP award and, from looking at our analysis, it does not seem that LeBron was snubbed in that year. For most of the categories, Kevin Durant outperformed LeBron in many of the observed statistical categories and, in the categories LeBron did better, Durant was only slightly below LeBron's statistics (see assists and steals). We would determine that the 2013-2014 season was not a season in which LeBron was snubbed for the MVP award.

In the 2014-2015 season, Stephen Curry won his first league MVP award. From our analysis, we see that Stephen Curry and LeBron James had similar statistics in the categories under observation. We see that Curry's PER was a bit higher than LeBron's which might indicate to us that there were other statistical categories not considered in this analysis that might explain the leverage Curry had over LeBron for MVP that season. From the bar plots, we see that LeBron James and Stephen Curry's statistics were close to one another so we determined that LeBron James was not snubbed in this year.

In the 2015-2016 season, Stephen Curry statistics improved from the previous season (where he won his first MVP award) while LeBron James' performance stayed around the same. Compared to the 2014-2015 season, the bar plot shows that Stephen Curry was an obvious choice over LeBron James for an MVP award. If he was able to win in the 2014-2015 season, then it makes sense that he was the clear choice for the 2015-2016 MVP award. From this, we determined that this was not a season where LeBron was snubbed for an MVP award.

In the 2016-2017 season, Russell Westbrook took home the league MVP. This comparison provides the clearest picture of all MVPs that LeBron did not perform well enough to win the MVP award in that year. The only statistic that LeBron did better than Westbrook (out of the observed categories) was blocks (and only by about 0.2 blocks per game more). We can say with confidence that LeBron did not get snubbed for an MVP award in this season. From our own personal knowledge, we know that this was the season that Westbrook averaged a triple-double (i.e. three statistical categories where he averaged a value 10 or greater).

In the 2017-2018 season, James Harden won the MVP award in that year. We see from the bar plot below that, in most statistical categories, James and LeBron had similar statistics. We also see, though, that James Harden's PER was higher than Lebron James' PER. This leads us to believe that there may have been other factors that improved James Harden's chances to win MVP. From this analysis, we would say that the similarity in statistics and Harden's slightly higher PER would not allow us to conclude that LeBron James was snubbed in this season.

In the 2019-2020 season, Giannis Antetokounmpo won his second MVP award (he was also the winner in the 2018-2019 season in the season that LeBron was not in the top 50 scorers list). We see from the visualization below that we can determine that LeBron did not appear to be snubbed for the award. Giannis performed better in most of the observed statistical categories and his PER was much larger than Lebron's. We note, though, that LeBron did significantly better in the assists category than Giannis but this was not enough when looking at the other categories. We should also point out that Giannis was also in our top 5 player analysis for having the highest PER in our data set during this season (out of 19 seasons). From this, we determine that LeBron was not snubbed for an MVP during that season.

Our analysis was based on each player's statistics and cross-checked from our own personal understanding of the NBA. With additional data and more research, we could provide an even more in-depth analysis on how each MVP won over LeBron James. It is also important to note that for many of these seasons, there were other players under consideration for MVP that did not win, but that LeBron has consistently been a top contender for the MVP even in seasons that he did not win the award. This analysis would be greatly beneficial for NBA fans who believe that LeBron should have won more MVPs and to use these statistics as a basis for their argument. 

## Testing

For our testing, we used the "unittest" library to test this out and applied a glass-box/white-box testing approach to test the logic of our code. We called our main project code and imported the "unittest.TestCase" parameter to do our unit testing and applied all the appropriate measures for the unit testing through the "unittest" library. 

For the three-point and Center position analysis, we wanted to confirm that the different data frames and series that were being created contained the actual number of values that we expected. So, we created assert statements to test that all of the seasons and positions were within each data set and that the smaller subsets added up to the large data set that it was grouped from. 

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/bEHYss65wL053JIR9ycKrSNVpg9NBT6-Qldr5sS2MppP1vQr1tz_UuNMo4xZyMoLHORtrewVcpVdHEv1mzO9IGUTrHaaX8EsSpr5LxJgFqgI6R9xx3MJD8GjhgQNIiqtLbuh8GK1)

To unit test the ranking system, first we wanted to see if the code was sorting the data set correctly. This was performed by grouping the data by name to get the mean values of each statistical category and then being able to sort based on each category. The category "Points Per Game" was used as an example for our unit test. The expected top player for mean points per game after averaging each player's points per game values throughout every season they appeared in the dataset was Allen Iverson. Once the list was grouped and sorted, it returned Allen Iverson as the first name and we can assert that these are equal and the code is sorting properly. 

Next, we wanted to unit test the ranking system itself. This was performed by grouping the data by name to get the mean values of each statistical category. These values were then sorted from highest to lowest and given a ranked value from 1 to 254 (there are 254 unique players in the dataset). Therefore, the player with the best statistic for that category should be ranked 1. The category "Field Goal Percentage" was used as an example for our unit test. The expected top player for mean field goal percentage after averaging each player's field goal percentage values throughout every season they appeared in the dataset was Clint Capella. Once the list was grouped, sorted, and ranked, it returned Clint Capella as the first name and we can assert that these are equal and the ranking system is ranking the categories properly.

For our top 5 starting lineup analysis, we wanted to confirm that we were capturing the maximum values for each category of interest. We used these maximum values to set the index in the data set so that we could grab other attributes related to the maximum value (i.e. player name and position). If we didn't find the correct max value, then the rest of our analysis would be incorrect based on those observed statistical categories. We used assertEqual() methods to compare the player we expected to get with the output of our code. We were able to find the maximum values for our categories of interest using the data set and compare that to our code output. We incorporated assertEqual() methods to compare the maximum values with the code output.

Continuing with testing the top 5 starting lineup script, we ran similar unit tests to determine that the appropriate players were put into the starting lineup. We used the "unittest" library for our unit testing and used multiple assertEqual() statements to compare our code's output with the correct result. We developed five separate unit tests to test and verify the five players of our starting lineup and confirm that our code was collecting the appropriate members. From the analysis, we wanted the players with the highest points per game, rebounds per game, assists per game, blocks per game, and PER (if there was a tie in any category, select the player that appeared first in the data set). From the data set, we were able to determine the players that should be in the list -- James Harden (points), Andre Drummond (rebounds), Steve Nash (assists), Tim Duncan (blocks), and Giannis Antetokounmpo (PER).

For our comparison of LeBron James vs the MVPs of seasons in which he did not win, we employed a similar testing strategy that we did for our top 5 starting lineup unit testing. We wanted to confirm that we were picking up the appropriate MVPs to compare with LeBron in each year. We researched online which players won the MVPs and collected them into a list chronologically. Our code collected each MVP in our script into a list and then we compared that list with the player we expected to be at a certain index. We used assertEqual() methods to make these comparisons between our list and expected results to test that feature of our code out. From there, we were able to confirm that we were comparing the right MVP players to LeBron in the appropriate seasons.

## Conclusions

Overall, our results indicated that over the years, there is a trend of increased reliance on the 3-point shot and decreased reliance on centers. We also showed that the top all-around players in the NBA based on a combination of different statistical categories were Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Stephen Curry, James Harden, and LeBron James. To select a top 5 starting lineup we determined based on top values within the observed statistical categories, we would choose James Harden (Shooting Guard) based on points per game, Andre Drummond (Center) based on rebounds, Steve Nash (Point Guard) based on assists, Tim Duncan (Center) based on blocks, and Giannis Antetokounmpo (Power Forward) based on PER. Lastly, we found that there were 4 potential seasons where LeBron James was snubbed of an MVP based on statistics from our dataset. From our analysis, we were able to query the data to demonstrate various trends within the NBA over the past couple decades while also putting statistical analysis behind some of the most common debates in the NBA community

These results could be used by any NBA fan who want to look at historical trends within the NBA. The NBA community is big on statistics and seeing the evolution of the game and its players over time. This knowledge could even be important to coaches or sports analysts to understand quantitatively how the NBA has changed over the years and what that means for the teams they coach/talk about. It allows insight into how these trends impact the current state of the game and what is to be expected in the future. Our analysis allows a data-centric focus to help answer some of the most highly debated topics in the NBA community. To improve our project, more unit testing could be performed on the data to ensure adequate responses from all aspects of the code. There are also infinite additional queries that could be performed on this dataset to analyze how the NBA has changed over time. There is potential to see if other players besides LeBron James were snubbed of an MVP throughout the years and to see who the worst players are when it comes to negative statistics like turnovers per game. In addition, we could expand on our program by trying to predict performance of players in future seasons. Based on the data set that we have, we could also potentially predict the players that would show up in the following seasons.
